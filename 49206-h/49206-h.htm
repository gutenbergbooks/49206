<p>"A box full of shells!" said Charles to his
sister Lucy, who was looking over her treasures
with great attention. "What can you want so
many little shells for?"</p>

<p>"This box and its contents are the gifts of my
cousin Jane," replied Lucy: "she said that I
might have her whole collection, if I could find
any pleasure in looking at shells without knowing
anything about them. But I am not <i>quite</i> ignorant
of the subject."</p>

<p>"Shells are pretty enough," said Charles;
"but how troublesome to distinguish the differences
between each kind! I like plants better
than shells."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p002" id="Page_p002">« 2 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MULTIVALVES,<br />BIVALVES,<br />UNIVALVES.</div>

<p>"Probably because you are better acquainted
with plants," observed his father, Mr. Elliot,
who had just entered the room: "however, the
great naturalist, to whom you are indebted for
your knowledge of plants, did not consider shells
as objects beneath his attention."</p>

<p>"You mean Linnæus," said Lucy; "then he,
I suppose, separated shells into the three different
divisions&mdash;<i>Multivalves</i>, <i>Bivalves</i>, and <i>Univalves</i>."</p>

<p>"You are right, Lucy," replied her father.</p>

<p>"Pray show me some bivalve shells," said
Charles; "I want to know their forms. A <i>bivalve</i>
is a shell with two openings, as I should imagine:
yes, I see that I am right, for you have given
me an oyster and a cockle."</p>

<p>"Here are also <i>Venus</i>, <i>Tellìna</i>, <i>Donax</i>, <i>Arca</i>,
and <i>Pinna</i>," observed Mr. Elliot, "all very easy
to distinguish."</p>

<p>
"'The anchor'd pinna and his cancer friend,'"<br />
</p>

<p>repeated Charles. "So the <i>Pinna</i> is a bivalve;
but what has <i>Venus</i> to do with the matter?"</p>

<p>"That is very easy to understand," said Lucy:
"the genus called by her name is remarkable for
beauty."</p>

<p>"Now, Charles," said Mr. Elliot, "do you
clearly comprehend the verse that you have just
repeated?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PINNA<br />AND THE<br />CANCER.</div>

<p>"I have heard that the <i>Pinna</i> is a shell-fish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p003" id="Page_p003">« 3 »</a></span>
attended by a <i>crab</i>, 'his cancer friend;' but why
it is called <i>anchor'd</i> I do not know, but <i>cancer</i>
is Latin for crab."</p>

<p>"Here is a species of <i>Pinna</i>," said his father,
opening a cabinet; "and these silken threads are
the means by which it fastens itself to the rocks.
The animal is provided with a long foot, with
which it draws out the threads, or <i>byssus</i>. The
<i>Pinna</i> is sometimes called the silk-worm of the
sea. Lucy, do you know a univalve shell?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, many!" replied Lucy, "here are
rock-shells, cowries, limpets, and cones. I know
the difference between a cowry and a cone; but I
am not yet acquainted with a multivalve shell&mdash;will
you show me one?"</p>

<p>"<i>Chiton</i>, or coat of mail, is a good example,"
said Mr. Elliot; "<i>Pholas</i> is another genus of
the same division; it has the appearance of a
bivalve. In the <i>Chiton</i> are several <i>lamina</i>, or
plates, which are connected by a membrane while
the living animal is in the shell; the membrane
is pliant, and the inhabitant has the power of
contracting itself into a ball, when it would avoid
injury, like the insect millepes, that we find
under stones in damp places. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate2">Plate 2.</a></span>) The
curious barnacle-shell, <i>Lepas</i>, is another multivalve."
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate1">Plate 1.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"I think we cannot have a more agreeable
pursuit for our leisure hours," said Lucy, "than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p004" id="Page_p004">« 4 »</a></span>
the study of shells. One can bring them out or
remove them so easily, that they can cause little
inconvenience, which garden-pots often do in
town; and then the plants are almost sure to die,
whatever care I take of them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAMARCK'S<br />SYSTEM.</div>

<p>"Collections of shells are frequently to be seen
in London," said Mr. Elliot, "which are intended
for sale. There are now many places
where shells are sold at moderate prices, and
young collectors like yourselves can easily avail
themselves of the means thus afforded, to obtain
even a single specimen. While we remain in town
you may visit the British Museum, and become
familiar with the rare species of each genus, of
which there are many costly specimens. The
arrangement adopted for that collection is Lamarck's.
You will find the work of this celebrated
naturalist on my shelves; it is entitled, '<i>Histoire
Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertèbres</i>.' The
three last volumes contain the Conchology."</p>

<p>"It is in French and Latin!" exclaimed Lucy,
as she opened a volume.</p>

<p>"Why do you both look so serious?" asked
their father. "Are you not students in those
useful languages? To what purpose do you learn
a language if it be not with a view to reading the
works of learned men, whose labours have opened
a wide field of knowledge?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">USE OF<br />THE LATIN<br />LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>"But so many works on science are written in
Latin," said Lucy. "Linnæus, however, has
been translated, I know; and as for <i>British</i>
botany, we have our own authors in my own dear
language."</p>

<p>"The Latin language being universally studied
by men of science, it has become the medium of
communication between the learned of most
countries," observed Mr. Elliot. "I should consider
a young person of your age, Lucy, very ignorant
who could not read and understand the
general style of Lamarck with the occasional aid
of the dictionary."</p>

<p>"Do not be discouraged, brother," said Lucy,
"my father will assist us: remember how frequently
he helps us with our lessons now, provided
we do our best. I am resolved to obtain some
knowledge of shells this winter."</p>

<p>"A very good resolution," said Mr. Elliot;
"and I predict that your usual delight on revisiting
our favourite country dwelling will be somewhat
increased next spring."</p>

<p>"Because I shall carry down my little collection
with the pleasure of knowing more than I
did last year."</p>

<p>"Our own coasts, rivers, and ponds afford
a variety of shells. The hedge-banks, heaths,
and other places, possess their inhabitants."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLEASURE OF<br />SEARCHING<br />FOR SHELLS.</div>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Lucy, "I quite forgot the
very pretty snails I have so often admired on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p006" id="Page_p006">« 6 »</a></span>
heath on a dewy morning: why, we may learn
conchology in the open fields as well as
botany!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Mr. Elliot, "to-morrow
we will apply ourselves to the needful instruction.
I must, however, remind you that I do not
approve of any animal's life being taken away in
order to obtain its habitation. Empty shells are
to be found, which will serve perfectly well for
specimens; and should the colour not be so bright
as you could wish, you will have the delightful
consciousness that your amusements have been free
from cruelty, and that you have not destroyed
the life of any living, harmless creature, in the
pursuit of pleasure. Indeed there is as much or
more gratification in searching among the rocks,
or digging into the sea-sand, with a view to watch
the animal in its natural place, as in possessing
its empty shell: and who knows what grand discoveries
you may both make!</p>

<p>"But I must leave you now&mdash;be ready for me
after our usual dinner-hour."</p>

<div class="sidenote">INHABITANTS<br />OF SHELLS.</div>

<p>"Conchology," said Mr. Elliot, on resuming
the conversation with his children, "is that
branch of natural history which comprehends the
study of testaceous animals, or animals with
<i>shell-coverings</i>, and includes those of the seas,
the rivers, and the land.</p>

<p>"All shells are formed of carbonate of lime.
This you may easily prove by applying a little
acid to a shell, and you will find that an effervescence
takes place.</p>

<p>"The animals that inhabit shells are bloodless,
without bones, but provided with a heart,
lungs, and mouth, together with other organs
needful to their conformation.</p>

<p>"Testaceous animals have the power of enlarging
their habitations; they can also repair any
injury that may occur to them.</p>

<p>"Many kinds of shell-fish are made use of by
man, and form a valuable article of food, such as
oysters, cockles, muscles, scallops. The whelk
is also used, and a species of murex.</p>

<p>"A species of cowry is in use for money among
some people of Africa; and pearls, so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p008" id="Page_p008">« 8 »</a></span>
valued as articles of ornament, are obtained from
the oyster and mussel genera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL<br />SHELLS.</div>

<p>"Within a few years, conchology has become
a study of considerable importance, from its close
connexion with geology. Students in the latter
science must be well acquainted with fossil-shells,
because they form so large a portion of organic
remains. Species of recent shells, or those still
existing, are also often found in a fossil state,
while many fossil genera are now totally unknown
in our earth and waters.</p>

<p>"Thus you perceive that while you are obtaining
knowledge in one science, you are preparing
yourselves for making advances in another,
most interesting and wonderful. You, Charles,
who are likely to become a traveller, will perhaps
in future years find the advantage of my present
brief lessons.</p>

<p>"I shall first endeavour to make you acquainted
with the system of Linnæus; it is easily
learned, and you should be familiar with it, as it
is still adopted by some writers on conchology.</p>

<p>"But in order to understand my instructions,
you must have a clear idea of the terms that I use
in describing a shell; now, therefore, give me
your attention while I explain some of those
terms to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERMS FOR<br />PARTS OF<br />MULTIVALVES.</div>

<p>"To begin with the first division, <i>Multivalves</i>.
There is a group of <i>Lepades</i>, it is the species
called goose-barnacle, of which so many strange
and silly tales have been told in former times.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate2">Plate 2</a></span>, <i>Lepas anatifera</i>.) This species is
furnished with a kind of stem, like a bladder, and
is called the <i>peduncle</i>, (<i>c</i>) and is fastened to other
bodies. The <i>feelers</i> (<i>d</i>) are feathery projections,
which the animal keeps in continual motion, for
the purpose of catching its food. Here is a group
of another kind; (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate2">Plate 2</a></span>, <i>Lepas tintinnabulum</i>;)
these are without a peduncle, and are
called <i>sessile</i>. The <i>base</i> (<i>a</i>) is that part of the
shell by which it is fixed to other bodies: (<i>a</i>) the
<i>operculum</i> is formed of four small valves on the
summit. (<i>b</i>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"In the shells of the second division, <i>Bivalves</i>,
we shall find a greater number of parts. <i>Valves</i>
are the different pieces that compose a shell.
When both the valves are alike in form, the shell
is called <i>equivalve</i>: when the valves are different
in the same shell, it is called <i>inequivalve</i>. <i>Mya</i>,
<i>Solen</i>, <i>Tellina</i>, are equivalves: <i>Ostrea</i>, <i>Anomia</i>,
<i>Pinna</i>, &amp;c. are inequivalves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERMS&mdash;<br />BIVALVES.</div>

<p>"The <i>hinge</i> is formed by the teeth of one valve
inserting themselves between those of the other
valve, in some genera; in others, by the teeth
fitting into the <i>cavities</i> of the other valve
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3.</a></span>, <i>a</i>.) When the teeth are placed in the
centre of the hinge they are called <i>cardinal teeth</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p010" id="Page_p010">« 10 »</a></span>
<i>Lateral teeth</i> are situated on the sides of the
valves, and are generally long and flat, sometimes
hollow. Some hinges are straight, others curved.
Here is the hinge of <i>Arca</i>, furnished with many
small teeth. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3</a></span>, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p>"The <i>ligament</i> is a membrane that connects
the valves, and keeps the hinge in its proper
place: it is always situated near the beaks. The
ligament is very perceptible in the cockle, in
<i>Pecten</i>, or scallop, in <i>Tellina</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The <i>beaks</i> are the most pointed parts of the
bivalve shell (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3</a></span>, <i>c</i>.); when the valves are
closed, the line where they meet is called the
<i>seam</i>. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3</a></span>, <i>d</i>.)</p>

<p>"The <i>anterior slope</i> is that part of the shell
where the ligament is placed, and is also called
the <i>area</i>. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3</a></span>, <i>e</i>.) The <i>posterior slope</i>, or
<i>areola</i>, is the other side of the beaks. (<i>f.</i>)</p>

<p>"The <i>lunula</i> is a crescent-like depression on
either the area or areola. The edge of the valve
is called the <i>margin</i>; it is often finely <i>crenulated</i>,
or toothed. The interior of the valve is called the
<i>cavity</i>. (<i>g.</i>) In the valves of this ark-shell here
are two broad marks, shining and glossy. (<i>g.</i>) In
those of the oyster and muscle that I now show
you, there is but one. These marks are <i>muscular</i>
impressions; they are the parts where the muscles
of the animal have been affixed, and are termed

<p>"A <i>cartilage</i> is the same as a ligament. When
the valves of a shell are very nearly flat, they are
said to be <i>compressed</i>: when a valve has teeth,
it is said to be <i>dentated</i>.</p>

<p>"When the valves of a shell do not shut close,
they are said to be <i>gaping</i>. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4</a></span>, <i>Mya</i>.)</p>

<p>"The third division, <i>Univalve</i> shells, have
also their several parts. The first section has a
regular spire. Here are two shells of this section,
<i>Voluta</i> and <i>Buccinum</i>, both sawed asunder, in
order to show the interior structure of the shell.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3.</a></span>) The aperture, or opening, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p012" id="Page_p012">« 12 »</a></span>
turned <i>towards you</i>, the front of a univalve is
seen; reverse it, and you see the back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERMS&mdash;<br />UNIVALVES.</div>

<p>"The top, or highest part, is the <i>apex</i>; (<i>a</i>)
the lowest part is the <i>base</i> of the shell. (<i>b.</i>)</p>

<p>"The <i>spire</i> (<i>c</i>) is formed of wreaths, or whorls,
(<i>ddd</i>) which terminate in the apex: the lowest
whorl is the body of the shell. (<i>e.</i>)</p>

<p>"The <i>aperture</i>, opening or <i>mouth</i>, (<i>f</i>) as it is
sometimes called, is on the right-hand when the
front of the shell is turned towards you. The
aperture is an important distinction in univalves:
some genera have a circular opening, as the
<i>Turbo</i>, or periwincle; some longitudinal, as the
cowry; others semi-lunar, as the <i>Helix</i>, or snail
genus. (For examples of these apertures see
<span class="smcap">Plates 1</span> and <span class="smcap">7</span>.)</p>

<p>"The <i>beak</i> is the lengthened process (<i>g</i>) at
the lower part of the shell.</p>

<p>"The <i>canal</i>, or <i>gutter</i>, runs through the beak.
(Both these parts are perceptible in <i>Murex</i> and
<i>Strombus</i>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7</a></span>.)</p>

<p>"<i>Sutures</i> are spiral lines which separate the
whorls; they are sometimes crenated, or notched,
sometimes sulcated, or furrowed.</p>

<p>"The <i>columella</i>, or <i>pillar</i>, extends through
the centre of the shell withinside. The <i>Buccinum</i>
and <i>Voluta</i> both show the columella. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3.</a></span>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERMS&mdash;<br />UNIVALVES.</div>

<p>"The <i>pillar-lip</i> of the aperture, or columella
margin, is on the left-hand side of the shell; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p013" id="Page_p013">« 13 »</a></span>
<i>outer</i> lip on the right-hand. Occasionally this
order is reversed, but not commonly.</p>

<p>"The <i>operculum</i>, or lid, in univalves is that
part which fits exactly into the aperture, and incloses
the animal; it serves as a door to the shell.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3.</a></span>) The operculum is either horny, like
that of the periwincle, or of a harder substance,
like the shell itself.</p>

<p>"The <i>umbilicus</i> is a circular hole in the body
of the shell. This perforation produces a very curious
effect when it is very large. When the umbilicus
is wanting, the shell is called <i>imperforate</i>.</p>

<p>"If the spire is truncated, it is <i>decollated</i>; if
it is surrounded with spires, it is <i>coronated</i>, or
crowned.</p>

The <i>teeth</i> in univalve shells, as the cowry, are
ridges upon the aperture. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate1">Plate 1.</a></span>) In <i>Voluta</i>
they are regular folds or plaits upon the columella.</p>

<p>"A <i>fissure</i> is a notch or slit, as in <i>Patella
fissura</i>. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"Some shells of this section are internally
lipped, as <i>Patella equestris</i>; (<i>Calyptræa</i> of
other authors, <span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3</a></span>;) some are chambered,
as the slipper-limpet; some are cap-shaped,

<p>"As you both assure me," said Mr. Elliot,
"that you do not fail to make yourselves familiar
with the <i>nomenclature</i>, or terms, used in conchology,
I shall proceed this morning to the arrangement
of Linnæus.</p>

<p>"This system is established upon the <i>outward</i>
appearances, or external characters, of the covering
bestowed by nature upon the animal, not upon
the form of the animal itself.</p>

<p>"The three principal divisions you are already
acquainted with, namely, <i>Multivalves</i>, shells
composed of several parts called valves; <i>Bivalves</i>,
formed of two parts; and <i>Univalves</i>, composed
of one part or piece only.</p>

<p>"These divisions contain several <i>genera</i>, and
the genera usually include many individual shells,
but occasionally only one.</p>

<p>"The characters of every genus are permanent,
and are therefore to be observed in every one of
the species contained in the genus.</p>

<p>"Species are determined by shape, colours, or

<p>Total number of genera in the arrangement of
Linnæus, thirty-six.</p>

<p>The genera marked with an asterisk, contain
species found in Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p018" id="Page_p018">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHITON.<br />LEPAS.</div>

<p>"Multivalves may be divided into two kinds,
the <i>pedunculated</i>, or those fixed to other bodies,
as rocks, stones, planks, &amp;c.; or <i>free</i>, as the
<i>Chiton</i> and <i>Pholas</i>.</p>

<p>"Our first genus is <i>Chiton</i>. The shell is easily
known. The fixed character is, many valves
placed over each other along the back. I have
already noticed the membrane which connects
the valves, which is also a permanent character.
It is elastic: the sides are either scaly, as in <i>C.
squamòsus</i>, (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate1">Plate 1</a></span>,) and hairy, or spinous.
The species are determined by the margins.
Some of the <span class="smcap">Chiton</span> genus are common upon our
own coasts; they are frequently found among seaweed
and stones, rolled up like a ball. <i>C. fasciculàris</i>
and <i>C. lævis</i> are British; there are some
other British species. The animal adheres to
rocks, like the <i>Patella</i>, or limpet. The number
of species forty.</p>

<p>"Second genus, <i>Lepas</i>. Shell multivalve,
fixed at the base; valves erect, or <i>upright</i>.</p>

<p>"Observe how much the situation of the valves
differs in <i>Chiton</i> and <i>Lepas</i>. It is scarcely possible
to mistake the one for the other. The
feathery tentacula, or feelers, of <i>Lepas anatifera</i>
are worthy notice, and in a state of motion must
be yet more beautiful. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate2">Plate 2.</a></span>) The common
acorn-shell, <i>L. balanus</i>, is to be seen very
frequently upon the shells of muscles, oysters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p019" id="Page_p019">« 19 »</a></span>
periwincles, whelks, in large groups. I see that
you are examining the different appearance of the
pedunculated and the sessile <i>Lepades</i>. Linnæus
made two divisions; later writers have separated
them into several distinct genera, which will be
noticed when we attend to Lamarck's system.
The species are forty-five, of which several are
found on the British shores, as <i>L. tulipa</i>, <i>L. diadema</i>,
<i>L. tintinnabulum</i>, <i>L. balanus</i>, <i>L. anatifera</i>,
&amp;c. The Indian, American, and Atlantic
oceans afford numerous species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHOLAS.</div>

<p>"Third genus, <i>Pholas</i>. Generic character:
shell bivalve, gaping or divaricated, with several
smaller hinges situated upon the hinge; hinge
recurved, with an incurved tooth."</p>

<p>"Father," said Charles, "I must say that the
<i>Pholas</i> shell is very unlike those of the multivalve
division: I think it should rank with bivalves."</p>

<p>"So many conchologists have judged; nevertheless
it possesses more than <i>two</i> valves, and,
according to the system, it must be forced into
the division of multivalves.</p>

<p>"The <i>Pholades</i> are found in company, but
each individual occupies a distinct habitation,
which the animal excavates for itself, either in
rocks, in wood, coral, or sponge; but the finest
specimens are usually to be seen in chalk. In
proportion as the animal increases in size, it enlarges
the cavity in which it is stationed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p020" id="Page_p020">« 20 »</a></span>
animal is supposed to effect this operation by
means of a corroding fluid that is secreted in the
body, and which it has the power of ejecting upon
the substance into which it has entered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHOLAS.</div>

<p>"The <i>Pholas</i> has the power of emitting a
phosphoric liquor, which shines with brilliancy in
the dark.</p>

<p>"I must remind you that the accessory valves
are fixed to the margin of the shell by a gelatinous
substance; this decays after the death of the
animal, and consequently the smaller valves are
frequently wanting.</p>

<p>"The number of species is twelve. Several of
them are found on our coasts. The <i>Pholas</i>
genus is without colour, but the reticulations in
some species are exceedingly delicate. <i>Pholas
candida</i> (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate2">Plate 2</a></span>) is found on the shores of
Kent; you will be pleased with the shells.
<i>Pholas dactylus</i> is larger and coarser, and not
at all uncommon.</p>

<p>"We have now finished our first division, and
must proceed to the bivalves."</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Second Division.</span>&mdash;<i>Bivalves</i>: 14 genera.</p>


<p>"I fear," said Charles, "that this new division
will be rather difficult, for my father tells me that
we must pay particular attention to the <i>hinges</i> of
bivalve shells."</p>

<p>"Then <i>apply</i> yourself to the study of hinges,
Charles, and your difficulties will chiefly disappear,"
answered Mr. Elliot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MYA.</div>

<p>"The hinge of <i>Mya</i>, the first on the list, is
easily known. The generic characters are, shell
gaping at one end, hinge mostly with one thick
spreading tooth, not inserted into the opposite
valve. The <i>Mya</i> race burrow in the sand. Here
is <i>Mya arenaria</i>, a large thick shell, frequent
on the shores of Kent: the large tooth is sufficiently
plain in <i>this</i> species. <i>Mya truncata</i>
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4</a></span>) is as common, and the curious membranous
case, which you will find attached to one
end of the shell, is a guide to the species. Both
these species are without colour, and have little to
attract in their outward appearance. The genus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p022" id="Page_p022">« 22 »</a></span>
however, according to Linnæus, varies exceedingly,
and contains forty-one species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOLEN.<br />TELLINA.</div>

<p>"<i>Solen.</i> Shell bivalve, open at both ends,
tooth of the hinge subulate, or awl-shaped, reflex,
often double.</p>

<p>"In this genus, the great length, in comparison
with the breadth of the shells in many of the
species, is remarkable: some are exceedingly
brittle. Our example, <i>Solen siliqua</i> (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate1">Plate 1</a></span>)
is a British species. The hinge is not in the
centre of the shell, but nearer to one end of it.
Some are shaped like the handle of a knife or a razor,
others are bent resembling the blade of a scimitar.
The <i>Solen</i> lives in the sands of the sea-shore,
often burying itself two feet deep, and retaining
its shell in a vertical position: thirty-five
species.</p>

<p>"The genus <i>Tellìna</i> is remarkable for the
beauty of the shells, and, according to the arrangement
of Linnæus, contains ninety-seven
species. The exterior is sometimes marked with
radiations: the surface of some shells is very
finely polished, while in others it is covered with
striæ and undulations. The species that you
have placed before me, Lucy, is <i>Tellìna Feroensis</i>;
the shell is finely striated, and has also
radiations. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"The generic characters are chiefly these:
shell compressed towards the anterior slope, teeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p023" id="Page_p023">« 23 »</a></span>
of the hinge mostly three, the lateral ones smooth,
in one valve. Two or three small species are
common on our coasts. I should also observe
that there is a convex fold on one valve and a
concave fold upon the other. Many of the
<i>Tellìna</i> genus are found buried in the sea-sands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARDIUM.<br />MACTRA.</div>

<p>"<i>Cardium.</i> Generic character: shell equivalve,
convex, ribbed, striated, or grooved, the
margin toothed: hinge with two teeth near the
beak, and a lateral one on each side: fifty-four
species.</p>

<p>"Observe how the beaks of this common <i>Cardium</i>,
cockle, turn inwards, and the bosses project.
Another striking character is the ribs, that
are generally longitudinal, and not concentric or
transverse, as in <i>Tellìna</i>, and, as you will see,
in <i>Venus</i>. <i>C. aculeatum</i> has small spines on the
valves; <i>C. costatum</i>, the ribbed cockle, is one of
the finest species of this genus, and <i>C. cardissa</i>
is a beautiful shell. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4.</a></span>) The common
cockle is <i>Cardium edule</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mactra.</i> Generic character: shell bivalve,
unequal sided, middle tooth of the hinge complicated,
with a small hollow on each side, and lateral
side-teeth: thirty-seven species.</p>

<p>"The shells of this genus are usually thin,
brittle, and remarkably light. <i>Mactra stultorum</i>
is a common species. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4.</a></span>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">DONAX.<br />VENUS.</div>

<p>"<i>Donax.</i> Margin of the shell often crenulate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p024" id="Page_p024">« 24 »</a></span>
the anterior slope very obtuse; hinge with two
cardinal teeth, and one lateral tooth.</p>

<p>"The most striking characteristic of <i>Donax</i>
is the broad, thick extremity of one end, gradually
lessening towards the other. A rich purple tint
is very frequent in these shells. <i>Donax denticulatus</i>
and <i>trunculus</i> are common British examples.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4.</a></span>) You must remark the ligament
of <i>Donax</i>, which is exterior.</p>

<p>"Our next genus ranks highest for beauty
among the bivalves, and takes its name from the
goddess <i>Venus</i>. The species amount to one
hundred and sixteen in the Linnæan system, but
other authors have formed several new genera.</p>

<p>"Shell bivalve, having the lips incumbent on
the anterior margin; hinge with three teeth, all
approximate, the lateral ones diverging at the lip.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Lucy, "that we shall find
this genus very difficult: I wish you would tell us
the new genera that have been formed out of it."</p>

<p>"Learn first to know the general appearance
of <i>Venus</i>, and remark especially the <i>teeth</i>. You
may also bear in mind that the <i>beaks</i> are almost
always turned <i>to</i> the posterior slope, and <i>from</i>
the ligament. The area and areola are also very
conspicuous: the area is generally large, and differently
coloured to the disk. <i>Venus Paphia</i> is
pretty. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate4">Plate 4.</a></span>) The spinous species, <i>V. Diòne</i>,
is more beautiful, and is the only shell of the
genus that has spines. The brown Venus, <i>V.
chionè</i>, is very smooth and polished; both
species are frequent in collections. The British
shells of this genus are neither numerous nor
very beautiful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPONDYLUS.</div>

<p>"<i>Spondylus.</i> Valves unequal, rough; hinge
with two recurved teeth, with a hollow between
them; shell sometimes eared. (See <span class="smcap">Plates 3</span>
and <span class="smcap">5</span>.)</p>

<p>"I think," said Lucy, "that the English name,
<i>thorny-oyster</i>, is not very suitable: it is more like
a scallop; but it differs from both in having two
strong teeth in the hinge, and I observed this
morning that neither the oyster nor the scallop
have any hinge."</p>

<p>"So that was the object you had in view,"
said Charles, "when you were so quietly handling
those shells in the kitchen: I confess I could
hardly help laughing; and now my father will
say that <i>you</i> are '<i>Eyes</i>,' and I the '<i>No Eyes</i>,' of
'Evenings at Home.'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might have made the observation,"
replied Mr. Elliot; "but you have reproved yourself,
which is far better.</p>

<p>"<i>Spondylus</i> can scarcely be mistaken from
any other bivalve shell. The species <i>gæderopus</i>
is remarkable for its projecting beak; the surface
is rough, with either tubercles or spines. Some
authors reckon only four species, others thirteen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p026" id="Page_p026">« 26 »</a></span>
The <i>Spondyli</i> are frequently found attached to
rocks at some depth in the ocean. The animal is
eaten on the coasts of the Mediterranean. We
have no British <i>Spondylus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHAMA.<br />ARCA.<br />OSTREA.</div>

<p>"<i>Chama.</i> Shell thick; hinge with a thick
tooth, sometimes crenate, obliquely inserted into
a corresponding channel. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate5">Plate 5.</a></span>) The shells
of this genus vary greatly, which you will perceive
upon comparing <i>C. gigas</i> and <i>C. cor</i>. (See
<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate9">Plate 9</a></span>, <i>Isocardia cor</i>.) The <i>Chama</i> genus is
usually ribbed, foliated, or scaly. <i>C. Lazarus</i>
is a beautiful species: <i>C. cor</i> is a British species,
and the only one. The whole number is twenty-five.</p>

<p>"Here is <i>Noah's-ark</i>, an example of the genus
<i>Arca</i>, and is found on our own coasts. The long
hinge beset with sharp teeth, inserted into each
other, renders the genus sufficiently marked; but
in some species the hinge is curved. The form
varies exceedingly. The number of species is
forty-five. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate5">Plate 5.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"<i>Ostrea.</i> In this well-known genus we lose
sight of the <i>toothed</i> hinge. Take that <i>Pecten</i>,
or scallop, which belongs to one division of <i>Ostrea</i>
in this system, and tell me what holds the valves
together. Charles is silent; what says Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Here are the remains of the same kind of
substance which we saw in <i>Donax</i> and in <i>Venus</i>.
I think it is called the <i>ligament</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well remembered," continued her father.
"The generic character of this very large portion
of bivalves is, shell bivalve, usually with unequal
valves: hinge without teeth, having a hollow
cavity or sinus, and sometimes grooved. Here is
a young common oyster, and, according to the
rule of our present system, this shell, <i>Ostrea
isognomon</i>, is of the same genus. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate5">Plate 5.</a></span>)
The number of species is eighty-four, of which
thirteen are British. The old shells of common
oysters are often covered with <i>Serpula</i>, <i>Lepas</i>,
and <i>Anomia</i>, and some kinds of corallines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANOMIA.<br />MYTILUS.</div>

<p>"The next genus, <i>Anomia</i>, is remarkable for
the thin, delicate, and almost transparent appearance
of the shells. The valves are unequal,
and frequently perforated near the apex; hinge
toothless; in the flat valve, two bony rays.</p>

<p>"<i>Anomia ephippium</i> has a large perforation,
through which the animal passes a ligament,
and attaches itself to other substances. These
shells are often to be found on oysters. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate5">Plate 5.</a></span>)
Species thirty-two.</p>

<p>"<i>Mytilus.</i> The principal characters are, shell
bivalve, rough, often affixed by a thick byssus,
or beard; hinge without teeth, with a hollow line
extending lengthways. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate3">Plate 3.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"The common muscle, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>, must
be well-known to you, and also the fine polish
that the shells will take when cleared of the rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p028" id="Page_p028">« 28 »</a></span>
exterior by artificial means, <i>Mytilus barbatus</i>
is not unfrequent on our shores; the colour is
brown, and the shell is shaggy. Number of
species, forty-nine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PINNA.</div>

<p>"Our last bivalve genus is <i>Pinna</i>. The generic
characters&mdash;shell bivalve, brittle, erect, gaping
at one end, throwing out a byssus; hinge without
teeth. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"The <i>Pinna</i> race are found plentifully in the
Mediterranean, the Indian, American, and Atlantic
oceans: the British seas afford three species.
The genus is noted for producing a fine byssus,
that is manufactured in Italy into various articles,
as gloves. The animal is sometimes used as an
article of food.</p>

<p>"An ancient writer asserts that the <i>Pinna</i> is
attended by a crab, that finds a habitation in its
shell, and repays the favour by giving notice, by
a gentle nip, when a fish comes within reach;
the <i>Pinna</i> opens the valves of the shell, and secures
the prey, which serves for the food of both.
Now, Charles, you know the whole sense of the
quotation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father," said Lucy, the next time they met
to pursue their study, "I think we have made
ourselves familiar with the various hinges of the
bivalve shells, which are becoming favourites with
us; but from the variety of fine specimens which
you have on your table, I see that we shall
be much gratified in examining the univalve
division."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARGONAUTA.</div>

<p>"My first genus is very beautiful," replied
Mr. Elliot; "it is <i>Argonauta</i>, or paper-sailor.
The shell is univalve, involute, unilocular, or
without chambers: the aperture cordate. (<span class="smcap">Plate
6.</span>) These shells are spiral, and remarkably
brittle. The argonauts are supposed to be the
shells that taught mankind the use of sails in the
earliest ages of society. In calm weather the
animal rises with its shell to the surface of the
water, and spreads its arms over the edge; these
arms answer the purpose of oars. It then spreads
a membrane for a sail, which can be turned in
any direction, and is impelled forwards by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p030" id="Page_p030">« 30 »</a></span>
breeze: two other arms serve as rudders to direct
the course. The animal first raises itself to the
surface of the sea by ejecting a quantity of water;
if danger occurs, it absorbs water, and thus, by
making itself heavier, sinks to the bottom. The
species are few in number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAUTILUS.<br />CONUS.</div>

<p>"<i>Nautilus</i>, pearly sailor, has several characteristics
of <i>Argonauta</i>; but the former is concamerate,
the latter without chambers in the shell.
The generic characters of <i>Nautilus</i> are, shell
univalve, divided into several compartments,
communicating with each other by an aperture.
<i>Nautilus pompilius</i> is often cut through, or bisected,
to display the chambers of the shell. In
the East, the shells are formed into drinking-cups.
Sometimes the outer coat of the shell is
removed, and the pearly surface finely carved.
This genus, according to Linnæus, consists of
fifty-eight species, some of which are fossil.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"In the following genera we must pay particular
attention to the <i>aperture</i> of the shell, which
is a generic distinction in most univalves.</p>

<p>"The first is <i>Conus</i>, a large and beautiful
genus, including many rare and valuable species.
Shell univalve, turbinate, aperture effuse, or
having the lips separated by a sinus, linear,
without teeth, pillar smooth. In their natural
state the shells are usually covered with an epidermis;
but will bear a brilliant polish. <i>C. textilis</i>,
cloth of gold, is valuable. <i>C. generalis</i> is
sometimes sold for twenty guineas. The example
on the table is <i>C. Ebræus</i>, or Hebrew cone.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6.</a></span>) Species one hundred and fifty-five;
not one British. The greater number are
brought from the Indian Ocean; some from the
seas of Africa and from the South Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CYPRÆA.<br />BULLA.</div>

<p>"The shells of the genus <i>Cypræa</i>, cowry, are
general favourites: the species are fifty-eight;
one British, <i>C. pediculus</i>. <i>C. moneta</i> (<span class="smcap">Plate
1</span>) is very common. The generic characters are,
shell univalve, involute, obtuse, smooth; aperture
linear, the whole length of the shell; effuse at
both ends, toothed on each side.</p>

<p>"Look carefully at those three shells: do you
perceive much resemblance between them?
'Not much, if any,' you reply, yet they are all
of the genus <i>Bulla</i>. Here is <i>B. lignaria</i>, <i>B.
terebellum</i>, (see <span class="smcap">Frontispiece</span>,) and <i>B. naucum</i>.
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6.</a></span>) There are other forms, as the <i>B. ovum</i>,
<i>B. volva</i>, the first somewhat like a cowry; but it
is toothed only on one side of the aperture; the
second has two long beaks.</p>

<p>"This genus is confessedly ill-determined.
<i>B. naucum</i> and <i>B. ampulla</i> are examples of the
common characters of the genus. The species
are sixty-one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p032" id="Page_p032">« 32 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">VOLUTA.<br />BUCCINUM.</div>

<p>"<i>Voluta</i> is also a large genus, containing one
hundred and eighty-six species. Shell univalve,
aperture without a beak, and somewhat effuse;
columella <i>plaited</i>. This latter character we meet
with for the first time. Here is the common
<i>Voluta</i>. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6.</a></span>) The genus has been much
diminished by forming other very striking genera
out of it, as I shall soon show you, under the
names of <i>Mitres</i>, <i>Olives</i>, <i>Gondolas</i>, &amp;c. <i>Voluta
musica</i>, the music-shell, is remarkable, and not
at all rare.</p>

<p>"<i>Buccinum</i> is another large genus. The shell
univalve, spiral, gibbous; aperture ovate, ending
in a canal turning to the <i>right</i>, with a short
beak; pillar-lip expanded. Species, one hundred
and seventy-two.</p>

<p>"You must recollect that when the apex of
the shell is turned <i>downwards</i> the canal turns to
the right, when it is turned <i>upwards</i> the canal
will be to the left hand. My example is <i>Buccinum
reticulatum</i>, a very common species upon our
own shores." (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"Is not this genus reduced by other authors?'
asked Charles.</p>

<p>"Greatly," replied Mr. Elliot: "you will
meet with tuns, helmets, harps, and needles.
Species of the <i>Buccinum</i> genus are found in the
African, American, Indian, European, and
Southern oceans. Eighteen occur upon our
coasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p033" id="Page_p033">« 33 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">STROMBUS.<br />MUREX.</div>

<p>"<i>Strombus</i> contains forty-four species. Shell
univalve, spiral, aperture much dilated, the lip
expanding, ending in a canal inclining towards
the left.</p>

<p>"You must notice the sinus in the outer lip,
near the base of the shell. <i>Strombus gigas</i>, the
West Indian conch, is very large. Some species
have the lip ending in claws. <i>Strombus pes-pelicani</i>,
the pelican's-foot, has four palmated claws:
(<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>) it is a British shell. The city of
Santa Cruz, in America, is paved with the shells
of <i>Strombus gigas</i>.</p>

<p>"The genus <i>Murex</i> is both large and beautiful.
Shell univalve, spiral; aperture oval, ending
in a straight canal.</p>

<p>"These shells are of very unequal form; their
surfaces frequently covered with spines, knobs,
or foliations. Some are remarkable for the great
length of the beak, (<span class="smcap">Frontispiece</span>,) such as the
woodcock, the snipe's-head, and Venus's-comb.
The <i>Murex</i> before you is foliated. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>)
The species are one hundred and seventy-one.
Several are found on British coasts, but they are
not remarkable for beauty.</p>

<p>"The top-shell, <i>Trochus</i>, is univalve, conic,
spiral; the aperture either angular or rounded;
columella oblique: some of the apertures have a
tooth-like projection. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>) Species, one
hundred and thirty. Several kinds occur in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p034" id="Page_p034">« 34 »</a></span>
Britain. New Zealand, Friendly Isles, Red Sea,
and most other seas, afford the various species.
Two of this genus have the power of collecting
parts of shells and other testaceous substances,
which adhere strongly to the whorls of the shell:
it is called the Conchologist. The other, named
Mineralogist, is loaded with stones, pebbles,
ores, &amp;c. When heavily laden they are considered
rarities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TROCHUS.<br />TURBO.<br />HELIX.</div>

<p>"There is a great similarity between the genera
<i>Turbo</i> and <i>Trochus</i>. You must observe the
generic distinction carefully. Shell univalve,
spiral; aperture contracted, orbicular, entire.
The one hundred and sixty-seven species have
been much divided by other writers. The golden-mouthed
<i>Turbo</i> is a very fine shell. This genus
also contains the common periwincle, an inhabitant
of most European shores. Sailors report that if
the animal is seen creeping high up the rocks, it
foretells stormy weather. <i>Turbo muricatus</i> is a
pretty shell." (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"Now we can tell the next genus," said Lucy.
"<i>Helix</i>, snail. But what a number of different
shapes, father, those shells have! they are not
all snails, I should think, that you have placed
on the table."</p>

<p>"According to Linnæus they are all of the
genus <i>Helix</i>, which contains two hundred and
sixty-seven species. Many kinds are land-shells;
others live in fresh water; few inhabit the
sea.</p>

<p>"Shell univalve, spiral, brittle; aperture contracted,
semi-lunar, or roundish. The common
snail is well-known to most persons. <i>Helix nemoralis</i>,
the wood-snail, is very pretty; sometimes
it is pink, with brown bands, or plain yellow,
or yellowy banded with brown. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>)
The greater part of this genus consists of shells
remarkable for their thin, brittle, and semi-transparent
substances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NERITA.<br />HALIOTIS.</div>

<p>"The <i>Nerìta</i> genus is very pretty: (<span class="smcap">Plate
7.</span>) the texture of the shell is in general much
thicker than that of <i>Helix</i>. The shell is spiral,
gibbous, pillar-lip transversely truncated, flattish.
Seventy-six species. <i>Nerìta polìta</i> is a handsome
species: those most valued are from the South Sea.</p>

<p>"We have now lost sight of the pillar-lip, and
in the genus <i>Haliòtis</i> we find a flat, ear-shaped
shell, the spire nearly hidden, the disk perforated
lengthways with pores. Species twenty-one. The
animals that inhabit the ear-shells fasten themselves
so firmly to the surfaces of rocks, that much force is
needful to disengage them: during the fine nights
of summer, the animal feeds on the herbage that
grows on the sea-shore. The sea-ear from New
Zealand, and that from California, are superb shells
of considerable size. The British species, <i>Haliòtis
tuberculàta</i>, is not uncommon. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate8">Plate 8.</a></span>)</p>

<p>"You are well acquainted with <i>Patella</i>, the
limpet: one species of this genus is very common
on the rocks by the sea-side. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate1">Plate 1.</a></span>)
In the <i>Patella</i> genus we lose sight of a spire;
the shell is nearly conic, and shaped like a basin.
The species are very numerous, exhibiting great
variety of form; the number is two hundred and
forty.</p>

<p>"The form of <i>Dentalium</i> is easily known.
The shell is univalve, nearly straight, tubular,
not chambered, and open at both ends.</p>

<p>"The species called elephant's-tooth is slightly
curved, the colour green, (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate2">Plate 2.</a></span>) It is
found in the European and Indian seas. There
are only twenty-two species. <i>Dentalium entails</i>,
the dog's-tooth, is very common.</p>

<p>"The <i>Serpula</i> genus is remarkable. The
shells are tubular, frequently closed at one end.
They are often found in clusters, adhering to
rocks, stones, fuci, shells, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"There is <i>Serpula triquetra</i> upon a <i>pecten</i>,

<p>"Lucy and I have been collecting a variety of
species," said Charles to his father, "since our
last lesson in conchology. We have also seen
several large collections of shells, one of which
was arranged according to Lamarck. I was
much pleased with the new genera taken from
<i>Buccinum</i>, <i>Bulla</i>, <i>Turbo</i>, and others.</p>

<p>"We are desirous of gaining information on
this new system, if you can spare a little time

<p>"Willingly," replied Mr. Elliot; "I anticipated
such a request, and have been making

that, upon meeting with a new genus, you may
be able to ascertain with some accuracy its place
in the old arrangement.</p>

<p>"Lamarck founds his system upon the structure
and form of the animals, so far as they have

but what a number of new genera are taken
from the single one of <i>Lepas</i>!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPLANATIONS.</div>

<p>"Since the time of Linnæus," replied Mr.
Elliot, "many more observations have been
made upon the shells that he had examined;
many new shells, both genera and species, have
been found; and there is little doubt that, if
Linnæus had now been living, he would have
found his own genera inadequate, and would
have established new ones. I fear you will
have to regret the opposite extreme, and complain
of the multiplicity of new genera, and new
names. Our object is to become familiar with
the shells, and by knowing the Linnæan name,
and that bestowed by Lamarck, two authorities
very generally cited, you may understand what
species is alluded to by modern conchologists.
The names of Bruguieres, Leach, Gray, and
Sowerby will often occur among many others.</p>

<p>"For example: let us take the plate of a
remarkable multivalve; you find that it is named
<i>Scapellum vulgare</i>, and that it is so called by
Leach. Below, you find '<i>Pollicipes scapellum</i>,
Lamarck;' and on referring to our comparative
lists we find that the shell was a <i>Lepas</i>, (<i>L.
scapellum</i> of Linnæus.)"</p>

<p>"But they have kept the specific name," observed
Charles.</p>

<p>"And made it the generic," said Mr. Elliot;
the peculiarities and variations are deemed insufficient
to found a new genus.</p>

<p>"This class," observed Mr. Elliot, "contains
all the bivalves of Linnæus, and some genera
taken from the univalves and multivalves.</p>

<p>"The animals of this class are <i>shell-bearers</i> or
<i>carriers</i>, they remain constantly fixed in their
habitations: the body is fastened to the shell by
one or two strong muscles: when the shell is
vacant we find the <i>cicatrix</i>. Refer to your
explanation of terms, and you will find the
word.</p>

<p>"The body is soft, without joints, without head
or eyes; it is wrapped in a mantle or tunic. The
mouth, always hidden in the tunic, is merely an
opening to admit food, without jaws or teeth.
The shell is always bivalve; the valves united
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p045" id="Page_p045">« 45 »</a></span>
by a hinge or a ligament; sometimes there are
accessory pieces to the valves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCHIFERA.<br />UNIMUSCULOSA.</div>

<p>"Some of the <i>Conchifera</i> are furnished with a
kind of foot, which enables them to move with
their shells, to draw out fibres by which they
fasten themselves to marine bodies. The muscles
that fasten the animals to their shells are
thick and strong; their use is, to close the valves
by contracting; when the muscle is relaxed, the
elastic ligament is sufficient to open them. The
<i>Conchifera</i> are all aquatic; some inhabit fresh
water, the others dwell in the sea.</p>

<p>"The class contains nineteen families and
two orders. The first order, <i>Bimusculosa</i>, contains
thirteen families. The first includes genera
that you will scarcely expect to find among the
bivalve shells.</p>

it receives no other nourishment than what the
waves contribute, and indicates no other sign of
life than opening and closing the valve of the

perish on the spot where they are at first produced.
I have noticed the muscle by which they
attach themselves. Lamarck informs us that a

"I think that the slug has what I now understand
to be a <i>shield</i>. I have often watched the
animal contract itself, and seen a broad, flat piece
upon the back, which I thought was a kind of
shelter for it."</p>

<p>"The <i>Limax</i>, or slug," continued Mr. Elliot,
"is, in fact, provided with a coriaceous escutcheon,
or shield, beneath which the animal partly
conceals itself. The <i>Limax agrestis</i>, or spinning-slug,
has the power of suspending itself by

a kind of thread, formed of the viscid substance
that covers the body.</p>

<p>"<i>Testacellus</i> is a very interesting genus, lately
found in England: the animal has a resemblance
to the common slug: it carries the shield on the

<p>"<i>Testacellus scutellum</i> feeds on earth-worms,
and can so much lengthen the body that it follows
them under-ground.</p>

fancy that I can guess how you obtained your
information. You have been buying these specimens,
and had the names from the shell-vender.
I hope your purchase did not cost much,
for they are not rare shells?"</p>

<p>"No; I should not choose to spend a large
sum, even from my purse, until I am a better
judge of the value of shells. But as our collection
is but small, I thought that Lucy would be
glad to see an addition to the stock."</p>

Elliot, "and notice the families of the next section,
which are all carnivorous, living on animal
substances. They have a projecting syphon,

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CERITHIUM.<br />TURBINELLA.</div>

<p>"The naturalist Bruguieres established the fine
genus <i>Cerithium</i>, mixed by Linnæus among
those of <i>Murex</i>, <i>Strombus</i>, and <i>Trochus</i>.
These shells are always turreted, having a short
canal at the base; the aperture oblong, oblique,
with a gutter turned backwards. (See <span class="smcap">Frontispiece</span>.)
Many are girded with zones, that are
granulated, or beset with little tubercles. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p083" id="Page_p083">« 83 »</a></span>
remarkable that <i>Cerithium giganteum</i>, a species
more than a foot in length, is found fossil in
France, and as a living species in the seas of New
Holland. <i>C. telescopium</i> is a fine shell from the
East Indies. <i>C. vertagus</i> is smooth, tawny-white,
with a recurved canal. It comes from the
Moluccas. Many species occur fossil in London
clay and in plastic clay: the Woolwich pits afford
specimens, and also of <i>Turritella</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Pleurotoma</i>, formerly united with <i>Murex</i>,
is distinguished by the singular <i>notch</i> in the right-margin
of the shell. One species, the Tower of
Babel, is well-known, and another is common
under the name of <i>Murex javanus</i>. The fossil
species are numerous.</p>

<p>"<i>Turbinella</i> is taken from <i>Murex</i> and
<i>Voluta</i>: some species are thick, heavy shells,
from the Indian seas.</p>

<p>"<i>Cancellaria</i> is an elegant genus: the shells
are varicose, reticulated, or cancellated; the
columella has folds upon it, varying in number,
the right-margin sulcated within. There are several
fossil species, which are considered very
beautiful.</p>

<p>"<i>Fasciolaria trapezium</i>, the Persian robe,
is a fine shell from the Indian seas, very common
in collections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUSUS.<br />PYRULA.<br />RANELLA.</div>

<p>"The genus <i>Fusus</i> consists of spindle-shaped
shells, of which <i>Fusus colus</i>, the distaff, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p084" id="Page_p084">« 84 »</a></span>
give an idea. They are covered with an epidermis
which conceals, in some species, the fine colours
beneath.</p>

<p>"<i>Fusus despectus</i> (<i>Murex</i> of Linnæus) is the
largest of the British turbinated shells, and very
common: it is the large whelk.</p>

<p>"<i>Fusus contrarius</i>, the reverse whelk, is
found fossil in the Essex crag.</p>

<p>"Among the shells of the <i>Pyrula</i> genus we
find <i>P. ficus</i>, the fig, placed by Linnæus among
the <i>Bulla</i> race. <i>P. spirillus</i> is a pretty species,
with a long canal and a flattened spire, having a
tubercle at its termination.</p>

shell from New Zealand.</p>

<p>"<i>Ranella</i>, thorny-frog, is frequent in collections:
there are several species: <i>R. crumena</i>
is easily obtained&mdash;you must purchase a
specimen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUREX.<br />TRITON.</div>

<p>"Notwithstanding the great reductions of the
<i>Murex</i> genus, it is still large, and contains very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p085" id="Page_p085">« 85 »</a></span>
fine species. The shells have <i>three or more</i>
varices upon each whorl; those in <i>Ranella</i> but
<i>two</i>; while <i>Struthiolaria</i> has a varix only on the
right-margin. The species are numerous, and
common in collections. <i>M. saxatilis</i> is white,
and zoned with rose-colour or purple. The foliations,
or branches, are erect. The Rose-bush is
pretty; and the wagtail, <i>M. motacilla</i>, will,
doubtless, be a favourite with you, as well as the
scoop, <i>M. haustellum</i>.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the resemblance of the
genus <i>Triton</i> to those of <i>Murex</i> and <i>Ranella</i>,
there are permanent differences which make them
distinguishable at first sight. I have already
noticed the varices of the preceding genera; in
<i>Triton</i> they never form longitudinal ranges, but
are alternate, few, and nearly solitary on each
whorl of the spire; these varices are generally
smooth and without spines.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> <i>Triton variegatum</i>,
the marine trumpet, is a large, handsome species,
from the Asiatic seas. <i>T. lampas</i> and <i>T. lotorium</i>

<p>"In the first genus the shells are terminated
below by a canal, or pointed beak; the right-margin
entire, or toothed, more or less dilated
with age, and having a sinus contiguous to the
canal. There is a specimen from our own coast,
<i>Rostellaria pes-pelicani</i>, the pelican's-foot: it
was <i>Strombus</i> of Linnæus. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7.</a></span>) There
are many of this species found in a fossil state.</p>

<p>"The <i>Pterocera</i> genus is easily known by the
digitated, or fingered, appearance of the right-margin.
The greater part of the species become very
large. Here we find the scorpion, with seven
digitations, from India; the spider, with the
same number, a large and fine shell, also from
India.</p>

<p>"<i>Strombus</i> has a short canal, the right-margin
dilated with age into a simple wing, having, at
the lower part, a sinus, separated from the canal
at the base of the shell.</p>

<p>"All the species are natives of hot climates;
some attain a very large size, such as <i>S. gigas</i>,
so frequently seen in shops, and as ornaments in
a room. <i>S. gibbèrulus</i> is a pretty little shell;
the white, gibbous whorls render it remarkable;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p087" id="Page_p087">« 87 »</a></span>
the interior of the lip is pink. <i>S. lineàtus</i> has
dark lines round the shell. <i>S. vittàtus</i> has a
very long spire; the colour is tawny, girded with
white: you may easily meet with this species.</p>

the helmets, <i>Cassis</i>, are both numerous and plentiful
in most collections. The straight aperture
slightly reminds you of a <i>Cypræa</i> perhaps, but the
short canal, abruptly turned back, is a clear distinction;
the right-margin generally toothed; the
columella folded, or wrinkled, transversely.</p>

<p>"<i>C. cornuta</i>, <i>C. flummea</i>, <i>C. arèola</i> and
<i>vibex</i>, are all well-known species, <i>C. cornuta</i>
has large tubercles like horns round the tip of the
shell. <i>C. arèola</i> is marked with chequers. <i>C.

called <i>Nassa</i>, of which <i>Buccinum arcularia</i>
will furnish an example. The columella has a
callosity very evident in the species <i>Pullus</i> and
<i>Thersites</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Ricinula horrida</i> has a ringent aperture of
a fine violet colour; the shell is thick, and covered
with large black tubercles. The genus
takes its name from a resemblance to the seeds of
<i>Ricinus</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Purpura</i> is a large genus: in certain of the
species the colouring-matter exists of which the
ancients formed their famous purple dye. It is
the last genus that offers any appearance of a
canal at the base of the aperture.</p>

<p>"<i>P. patula</i>, the scoop, from the Atlantic and
Mediterranean, has the aperture remarkably dilated,
the margin sulcated.</p>

<p>"<i>P. lapillus</i> is a common British shell among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p089" id="Page_p089">« 89 »</a></span>
the chalk-cliffs of the coast; the colour varies,
sometimes white, at others yellowish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONOCEROS.<br />CONCHOLEPAS.<br />HARPA.</div>

<p>"I shall describe a species of the singular
genus <i>Monoceros</i>, by which you will scarcely
fail to recognise it.</p>

<p>"The columella is flattened like <i>Purpura
patula</i>; just within the outer lip is a row of
small teeth; but the principal peculiarity is a
process, or horn, near the outer part of the lower
lip, and close to the canal, from which the genus
derives its name <i>Monoceros</i>, <i>one-horn</i>. It is
brought from the seas of America.</p>

<p>"<i>Concholepas Peruviana</i>, the only species,
is also a remarkable shell. The aperture is very
large, almost equal to the shell itself; the spire
is near the edge; the outside is marked with ribs,
or costæ; there are two short teeth on the right-margin.
This shell was placed among the
<i>Patella</i>.</p>

<p>"The beautiful genus <i>Harpa</i>, harp-shell, is
remarkable for its elevated ridges on the back of
the shell, its large aperture, and its fine colouring.
They are East Indian shells. <i>H. ventricosa</i>
is a common species. <i>H. nobilis</i> is very fine,
and also <i>H. costata</i>.</p>

<p>"Equally well-known are the Tuns, <i>Dolium</i>,
by their globose form, the right-margin toothed,
and a canal below. They reach a large size, and
are light shells in proportion to their bulk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p090" id="Page_p090">« 90 »</a></span>
<i>Dolium galeum</i> is sometimes the size of the
human head. <i>D. perdix</i> is a choice species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOLIUM.<br />BUCCINUM.<br />EBURNA.</div>

<p>"<i>Buccinum</i> contains some British species, as
<i>B. reticulatum</i>, (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate7">Plate 7</a></span>,) <i>B. anglicanum</i>, <i>B.
undatum</i>, which is very common. In connexion
with this species I wish you to know that a marine
substance, called by sailors <i>sea-wash balls</i>,
by others sea-sponge, and extremely common on
all our sea-coasts, is the egg-cases of the <i>Buccinum
undatum</i>. The mass is remarkably light,
and composed of numerous little cells, each of
which has an opening. The colour varies from
yellow to white."</p>

<p>"I know them well," exclaimed Lucy, "how
often I have asked the name of those nests, but
never could I obtain a reply worth having!
And now, father, give me leave to interrupt you
a few minutes. What are those black, stiff,
marine substances, with a horn-like projection
at each of the four corners; they are all hollow,
and open at each end, I think, and usually inflated?"</p>

<p>"The egg-cases of the scate."</p>

<p>"Thank you, father, I will examine them
again carefully when I am at the sea-side."</p>

<p>"The genus <i>Eburna</i>," continued Mr. Elliot,
"is remarkable from the smoothness of the shells.
<i>E. spirata</i>, the Joppa whelk, has the whorls
deeply channelled. (See the <span class="smcap">Frontispiece</span>.)

two species are very common in collections. <i>C.

the outer lip is thickened in the middle, and
toothed; the columella is plaited: the animal is
furnished with an operculum.</p>

<p>"<i>Columbella nitida</i> is another pretty species,
smooth and shining: you may perceive the
generic marks if you look closely&mdash;two small
folds on the pillar-lip, and the swelling, toothed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p092" id="Page_p092">« 92 »</a></span>
outer margin. They are all West Indian marine
shells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MITRA.<br />CYMBA.<br />MELO.</div>

<p>"<i>Mitra</i> is a large genus, and it is believed
that there are three times as many species yet
undescribed. The mitres are natives of warm
climates, and few are common. The pillar-lip
of <i>Mitra</i> is parallel, with transverse folds; the
base has a slope, but no canal; the margin of
the columella is thin and rolled back. <i>M. episcopalis</i>,
the bishop, is white with red spots; the
columella-folds are four. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate9">Plate 9.</a></span>) <i>M. papalis</i>,
the pope's-mitre, has five; the upper
whorls are broken into a kind of crown.</p>

<p>"In <i>Cymba</i>, the gondola, the spire ends in a
tubercle, and scarcely appears; the aperture is
wide: they are very pretty shells.</p>

<p>"<i>Melo</i>, the melon, from the Indian Ocean, is
a very fine genus; here the spire is evident.</p>

<p>"<i>Voluta musica</i> will serve as an example of
the genus. The animal is carnivorous.</p>

<p>"<i>Marginella</i> is an oblong, smooth, and polished
shell; its peculiar character is the thickened
outer lip; it is a neat, small species, prettily
coloured.</p>

<p>"<i>Volvaria</i> is a cylindrical shell, convolute,
the spire nearly hidden; the aperture straight, as
long as the shell. There is a fossil species found
in London clay. <i>V. monilis</i> is sometimes strung
for necklaces. It comes from Senegal.</p>

<p>"<i>Ovula</i>, you will recollect, was formerly confounded
with the <i>Bulla</i> genus: the form is egg-shaped,
the outer lip toothed in one division,
smooth in the other; the shells are white and
polished, particularly <i>O. oviformis</i>, the poached-egg,
from the Moluccas.</p>

<p>"<i>O. volva</i>, the weaver's-shuttle, is a rare and
highly-valued species. It is nearly globular in

<p>"You can be at no loss on seeing the shells of
<i>Cypræa</i>, a large and beautiful genus, which remained
unchanged for a long time. Lately, we
find a few of the small species are become a new
genus, <i>Trivia</i>.</p>

<p>"The character of the <i>Cypræa</i> is a longitudinal
aperture, toothed, in the adult state, on each
side. The spire is scarcely to be seen.</p>

<p>"While the shells are young they have the
appearance of a <i>Voluta</i> or a cone; the aperture
spreads more, and is without teeth.</p>

<p>"The individuals of each species pass through
three different states:</p>

<p>"In the first, the form is very imperfect; it is
like a thin cone, and shows no character of the
genus; hence young students are perplexed if
they chance to have a young cowry in their
collection.</p>

<p>"In the second state, the shell is still thin, with
a <i>projecting</i> spire; but attains its proper form.</p>

<p>"In the third, or adult state, the shell is
thick, the colours are perfected, and the spire is
very nearly concealed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CYPRÆA.</div>

<p>"The inhabitant of the <i>Cypræa</i> shells has two
tentacula of a conic form, and finely pointed;
the foot discous, and sometimes tongue-shaped.
The mantle is two-lobed, with wing-like margins,
capable of being turned back over the shell: this
mantle preserves the shell from injury when the
animal issues forth in search of food. The genus
abounds both in the old and new world; but the
larger kind chiefly in warm climates. They live
on the coast, and are generally found under
stones or rolled coral. A very few species are
natives of the European seas.</p>

<p>"The tiger-cowry is before you; a large and
very common species in collections; it also frequently
adorns the mantel-piece. There is a remarkable
line extending along the back of the
shell; at this part the edges of the <i>mantle</i>, that
I have before noticed, meet: this line is conspicuous
in many species.</p>

<p>"<i>C. aurora</i> is a costly shell from Otaheite
and New Zealand; the colour orange, with the
base and extremities white. It is large, and has
been sold for 60<i>l.</i> when a specimen has been obtained
without any perforation. The shell is
worn by the New Zealand chiefs as a badge of
honour.</p>

<p>"<i>C. exanthema</i> changes its appearance greatly
as it advances in growth. While young, three
bands extend over the back, which in its adult
state disappear, and the fawn-coloured ground is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p096" id="Page_p096">« 96 »</a></span>
spotted over with numerous white circular
marks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CYPRÆA.</div>

<p>"<i>C. mauritania</i>, the moor, is a fine species,
with very black sides, and tawny-yellow back with
spots. It is a native of Java.</p>

<p>"<i>C. caput-serpentis</i>, the serpent's-head, has
dark sides, with white fauces: the back is covered
with net-work colouring: the fauces, you
must remember, are the narrow entrances at each
end of the shell.</p>

<p>"<i>C. Isabella</i>, the orange-tip, with pale flesh-colour
back, and the fauces orange-colour.</p>

<p>"<i>C. Arabica</i> is a common species in collections.</p>

<p>"<i>C. mappa</i> is varied with deep brown or yellow
lines and spots: the dorsal line is laciniated.</p>

<p>"<i>C. talpa</i>, the mole, has the back fawn-colour,
with three zones of pale yellow; the base
and sides sometimes nearly black. It comes from
Madagascar.</p>

<p>"<i>C. vitellus</i>, the fallow-deer, is fawn-colour,
covered with small white spots: from the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p>"The wasp, <i>C. asellus</i>, is white, with three
brown bands.</p>

<p>"<i>C. helvola</i>, the star-cowry, has the sides
dark orange; the fawn-coloured back studded
with small spots. It comes from the Maldives.</p>

<p>"<i>C. moneta</i>, the money-cowry, is generally
white, sometimes yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p097" id="Page_p097">« 97 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TÆREBELLUM.<br />OLIVA.<br />TRIVIA.</div>

<p>"<i>C. annulus</i>, the ring-cowry, has a yellow
mark round the top of the shell. The fowl-cowry,
<i>C. moneta</i>, is used for money by the natives
of Siam and Bengal.</p>

<p>"<i>C. pediculus</i> is changed to <i>Trivia</i>, a new
sub-genus from <i>Cypræa</i>. We find the following
characters:&mdash;form of the columella internally
concave, ribbed; shell sub-globular, cross-ribbed.
<i>T. carnea</i>, flesh-coloured shell; thin,
pure rose-coloured, with very thin, distant ribs;
lips whitish: it has sometimes an indistinct
dorsal groove.</p>

<p>"<i>Trivia Europæa</i> (<i>Cypræa</i> of authors) is a
globose shell, ash or flesh-coloured, with three
black dots and a whitish dorsal streak; ribs close,
rather thick, and whitish; base white; outer
lip wide. The variety has the back without spots.
<i>T. pediculus</i> has six square dorsal spots; the
colour of the shell pale red; ribs rather thick-covered;
dorsal line narrow; base reddish.
Only one species, <i>C. Europæa</i> (or <i>Trivia</i>) is
a native of our shores.</p>

<p>"There are several fossil species of <i>Cypræa</i>.</p>

<p>"We now pass on to a genus in which there
is but one recent species, <i>Terebellum subulatum</i>,
<i>Bulla</i> of Linnæus. (See <span class="smcap">Frontispiece</span>.) A
fossil <i>Terebellum</i> is found in London clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p098" id="Page_p098">« 98 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ANCILLA.<br />CONUS.</div>

<p>"The <i>Oliva</i> genus contains smooth, shining
shells, common, and therefore little valued;
nevertheless they are beautiful, and of various
colours.</p>

<p>"The columella is obliquely striated; the
aperture longitudinal and straight. The olives
were placed by Linnæus among the <i>Volutæ</i>, on
account of the striæ on the columella, without
regard to the peculiarity of the <i>canal</i>, by which
the olives are known from all other shells. This
canal separates the <i>volutions</i> of <i>Oliva</i>. Many
species are prettily marked by nature, others are
rendered handsome by polishing. <i>O. subulata</i>
is small, and pointed like a mitre. The common
olive is white, with brown, waved lines. <i>O. irrisans</i>
is ornamented with yellow zigzag lines:
it has two brown zones. <i>O. oriza</i>, the little rice-olive,
is white.</p>

<p>"I should have noticed the small genus <i>Ancilla</i>,
formerly <i>Ancillaria</i>, which is very near
both to <i>Terebellum</i> and <i>Oliva</i>. The columella
has a varix at the base, which distinguishes it
from <i>Terebellum</i>, and it wants the canal which
separates the volutions of <i>Oliva</i>.</p>

<p>"There are several fossil species.</p>

<p>"The concluding genus of the third order is
very large, and contains rare and costly shells.
This is <i>Conus</i>, scarcely to be mistaken for any
other genus except <i>Voluta</i>, and that only at a
first glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p099" id="Page_p099">« 99 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONUS.</div>

<p>"The species are covered with an epidermis,
sometimes very thick; the spire has various degrees
of elevation, sometimes almost flat; the
operculum very small and horny. They are natives
of southern and tropical seas: the animal is
carnivorous: found in sandy mud, at various
depths of the ocean. The species are very numerous&mdash;Lamarck
makes 181 recent. Some
new species have lately been discovered. Many
of the cones are very beautiful, both in shape and
colour, and the genus has been always in estimation
among collectors. The <i>gloria-maris</i>, <i>cedonulli</i>,
<i>ammiralis</i>, and some others, have been
sold at very high prices, and some of the finest
of these are now in England.</p>

<p>"Lamarck makes two divisions: in the first is
comprehended the species with coronated spires;
the second those with simple spires; the latter division
contains far the greater number.</p>

<p>"Fossil cones occur, in London clay and crag,
in England.</p>

<p>"No recent species are found upon our own
coasts.</p>

<p>"<i>Conus Hebræus</i>, the Hebrew-cone, is easily
known: (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6</a></span>:) it has a white ground, and
square black markings.</p>

<p>"<i>Conus virgo</i> is white, with a purple base.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONUS.</div>

<p>"<i>C. marmoreus</i> is a fine shell. Numerous
species are within reach of your purses, and I do
not doubt that you will soon acquire a good collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p100" id="Page_p100">« 100 »</a></span>
at a moderate price. You, Charles, will
find more pleasure in a cone than in a top; and
Lucy, who never found much pleasure in toys
except in taking them to pieces, has always a
ready sixpence either for a poor neighbour in distress,
or for some harmless pleasure.</p>

<p>"We have yet two more orders of <i>Mollusca</i>
to notice, the <i>Cephalopoda</i> and the <i>Heteropoda</i>.</p>

<p>"At our next lesson I shall mention the genera
that are most likely to come under your observation,
either fossil or recent."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARGONAUTA.<br />NAUTILUS.</div>

<p>"So many families of the fourth order, <i>Cephalopoda</i>,
are found only in a fossil state, and which
you will not easily meet with, that I shall not consider
it needful to give you the whole catalogue,"
observed Mr. Elliot to his young pupils at the
beginning of the next lesson.</p>

<p>"But we are exceedingly interested about
fossils," replied Charles; "pray do not pass any
species that we may be likely to find."</p>

<p>"And I," said Lucy, "have much wished to
ask whether the <i>snake-stone</i> ever was a shell? it
is something like a <i>Planorbis</i>, but heavy and imperfect."</p>

<p>"I will answer your question presently," said
her father. "Tell me what genera remain to be
noticed among the univalves of Linnæus?"</p>

<p>"<i>Argonauta</i> and <i>Nautilus</i>," was the ready
reply.</p>

<p>"The animals inhabiting these shells are <i>Cephalopoda</i>.
The word indicates the position of
the feet, or more properly <i>arms</i> of the animal,
which are ranged round the head like a crown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p102" id="Page_p102">« 102 »</a></span>
The body is thick and fleshy, contained in a kind
of bag, whence the head issues, surrounded by
these arms, which vary in different genera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CUTTLE-FISH.<br />BELEMNITE.<br />SPIRULA.</div>

<p>"The common <i>cuttle-fish</i>, a native of our seas,
will give you an idea of a cephalopode.</p>

<p>"In the first family a fossil-shell occurs that
is very frequently met with.</p>

<p>"Family, <i>Orthocerata</i>; genus, <i>Belemnite</i>,
thunder-stone, or arrow-head. These fossil-shells
occur abundantly in the chalk formations.
Many superstitious notions have been attached to
this extinct marine animal: of these you will find
an account in the 'Penny Cyclopædia.'</p>

<p>"In the family <i>Lituolita</i> we meet with the delicate
and remarkable little shell <i>Spirula Peronii</i>,
distinct from <i>Nautilus</i> by the separation of the
volutions: it is nearly covered by the body of the
animal. The colour is white; the texture thin
and brittle: it has a lateral syphon, the orifice of
which is very clearly to be seen as each compartment
is taken off. There is but one species; it
is found in the Southern Ocean and the Moluccas.
The shells are seen floating on the surface of the
water when the animal is dead, and are sometimes
carried to the shore. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate9">Plate 9.</a></span>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMMONITE.<br />NAUTILUS.</div>

<p>"Another family of this order, <i>Nautilacea</i>,
contains, among many other genera, the celebrated
<i>Nautilus</i>. This genus, you are already
informed, is distinguished from <i>Argonauta</i> by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p103" id="Page_p103">« 103 »</a></span>
its shells being many-chambered. Two or three
fossil species have been found in London clay.</p>

<p>"Among the various fossil-shells abounding
in different strata, not known in a recent state, the
one most remarkable and frequently occurring is
the Ammonite, <i>Cornu Ammònis</i>, so called from
the resemblance it bears to the convoluted horns
of Jupiter Ammon, in mythological history.
This is your <i>snake-stone</i>, Lucy, a local name,
which you had better change for Ammonite.
Various legends are connected with this fossil, of
which you may obtain information by consulting
the before-mentioned publication.</p>

<p>"As you are desirous of studying geology, a
knowledge of the Ammonites is very requisite,
since whole sections of the genus are characteristic
of certain strata.</p>

<p>"They are nearly allied to the <i>Nautilus</i>.
The species are very numerous; one hundred and
twenty according to some authors&mdash;two hundred
and seventy species are enumerated by others.
They occur in Europe, Asia, and America: they
have been found in the chalk with a diameter of
three feet.</p>

<p>"In the second division of this order the genus
<i>Argonauta</i> occurs: the shell has been already described,
and retains its original name. (<span class="smcap"><a href="#plate6">Plate 6.</a></span>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">OCTOPUS.<br />LOLIGO.<br />SEPIA.</div>

<p>"In the third division is the family <i>Sepiaria</i>,
containing <i>Octopus</i>, <i>Lolìgo</i>, and <i>Sepia</i>. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p104" id="Page_p104">« 104 »</a></span>
section contains animals without shells. <i>Octopus
vulgàris</i> is common in the European seas. In
hot climates it grows to a very large size. The
animal has sufficient strength to draw a boat
under water.</p>

<p>"<i>Lolìgo</i> also is found in our seas; the thin,
transparent rib, called the <i>dorsal blade</i>, you may
probably find on the shore, the flesh that covered
the blade being cleared entirely from it. The colour
is either white or brown. It is called <i>sea-sleeve</i>.</p>

<p>"The bone of the cuttle-fish, <i>Sepia officinalis</i>,
is so frequently thrown on shore by the waves,
that few persons visiting the sea-coast can be ignorant
of its form. You have a large collection
there I see, Lucy; and you are doubtless aware
that this calcareous bone affords the <i>pounce</i> of the
stationers, when finely pulverized: it also forms
one ingredient of tooth-powder.</p>

<p>"The ink of this marine animal is contained
in a bag: the use of the fluid is to colour the
water around, in order to conceal itself from
hostile attack. The flesh of some of these animals
is used for food, and is frequently seen in
the market at Naples. In the British isles it is
not put to any culinary purpose. The ink of <i>Sepia</i>
can be prepared for a pigment, or paint.</p>

<p>"The fifth and last order of the twelfth class
is <i>Heteropoda</i>, which contains only a few genera,
one of which I shall notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p105" id="Page_p105">« 105 »</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CARINARIA.</div>

<p>"<i>Carinaria</i>, the glass-nautilus, is a rare and
very precious genus, containing but three species.
The first, <i>Carinaria ritrea</i>, has been found in
the Southern Ocean. There is a model of the
shell in the British Museum; that of Paris possesses
the shell itself.</p>

<p>"<i>C. Mediterranea</i> is found in the neighbourhood
of Nice, and is frequent in the summer
months. So thin and delicate is the shell that it
is seldom found entire.</p>

<p>"The shell of <i>Carinaria</i> is wholly external,
and is attached to the upper part of the body,
apparently to protect the organs of respiration.
The body is transparent, dotted with elevated
points; on the lower part is a beautiful reticulated
fin, of a reddish colour; with the end of
this fin it floats along, carrying its delicate shell.
The habit of the animal, which swims upon its back,
reverses the natural position of the shell, which
is on the upper part of the body when at rest."</p>

<p>"That is one of the most remarkable creatures
you have yet mentioned," said Charles; "I may
chance to meet with a specimen when I travel."</p>

<p>"Probably," replied Mr. Elliot; "but our
lessons are now concluded&mdash;<i>Carinaria</i> is the last
genus."</p>

<p>"How greatly we are obliged to you, father!"
said Lucy: "but I hope you will still give us a
little advice and assistance: we shall often be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_p106" id="Page_p106">« 106 »</a></span>
unable to determine the genera of some shells, I
am sure, especially among the bivalves."</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHOD OF<br />CLEANSING<br />SHELLS.</div>

<p>"Most willingly: but tell me if you know the
easiest method of cleaning shells when they become
soiled, or when you purchase them in the
natural state?"</p>

<p>"That is a question I wished to ask."</p>

<p>"A little warm water and soap will cleanse
and render them bright. Some collectors rub
Florence oil over their shells, which prevents
them from becoming dry. A weak solution of
gum-arabic is sometimes applied, in order to
produce a polished and bright appearance.</p>

<p>"Nitric or muriatic acid, diluted, is used to
take off the epidermis, or any extraneous matter;
but it must be done carefully, and the shell
plunged in water after the acid has been applied.
But do not make a practice of polishing; shells are
best in their natural state, generally speaking."</p>

<p>"Thank you, father!" said both the young
people.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to any instruction I can
give you," he replied; "and now farewell for
to-night."</p>
